## 💭 A Note from Me

Hey! I'm just a solo dev working on this in my spare time because I love FM as much as you do. These features will come whenever I can find the time to build them (and when I'm not too distracted playing FM myself 😅).

If you have ideas or feedback, feel free to reach out! This is a passion project, so I'm always happy to chat with fellow FM fans about what would make the app more useful.

No promises on timelines – I'll add stuff when inspiration strikes and the coffee is strong! ☕

Cheers!
- Your friendly neighborhood FM dev
